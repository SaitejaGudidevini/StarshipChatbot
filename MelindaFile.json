It provides detailed information on FACS-based action unit (AU) references and the facial muscles they correspond to. The sheet also includes references and descriptions for anatomically-based facial movements not documented in FACS.\n\n### Relevant Links\n1. **FACS Lite: Photos (FREE)**: [https://melindaozel.com/facs-lite-still-fast/](https://melindaozel.com/facs-lite-still-fast/)\n2. **FACS Study Guide (PAYWALL)**: [https://melindaozel.com/facs-study-guide/](https://melindaozel.com/facs-study-guide/)\n3. **Viseme Cheat Sheet (FREE)**: [https://melindaozel.com/viseme-cheat-sheet/](https://melindaozel.com/viseme-cheat-sheet/)\n4. **ARKit to FACS Cheat Sheet (FREE)**: [https://melindaozel.com/arkit-to-facs-cheat-sheet/](https://melindaozel.com/arkit-to-facs-cheat-sheet/)\n\n### Instructions\nThe FACS Cheat Sheet is organized by facial regions, including the forehead, eyes, middle face, lips, and jaw. Each section details specific action units (AUs), their corresponding facial muscles, and the actions they perform. The guide also includes notes on variations, related actions, and distinctions between similar AUs.\n\n### Important Details\n1. **Action Units (AUs)**: The sheet lists various AUs, such as AU1 (inner brow raiser), AU6 (cheek raiser), and AU12 (lip corner puller), along with their actions and corresponding muscles.\n2. **Non-FACS Movements**: The guide also documents facial movements not included in the original FACS system, marked as \"#notFACS,\" such as \"ears up & back\" and \"open-eyed blink.\"\n3. **Muscle Anatomy**: Detailed information about the facial muscles involved in each AU is provided, along with notes on muscle variability and interactions.\n4. **Citations**: The page provides citation information in APA and BibTeX formats for referencing the FACS Cheat Sheet.\n\n### Additional Resources\n1. **Premium Resources**: [https://melindaozel.com/premium-resources/](https://melindaozel.com/premium-resources/)\n2. **FACS Lectures & Training**: [https://melindaozel.com/services/lectures-training/](https://melindaozel.com/services/lectures-training/)\n3. **Other Cheat Sheets**: Links to other related cheat sheets, such as the Viseme Cheat Sheet and ARKit to FACS Cheat Sheet, are provided at the bottom of the page.\n\n### Publication Details\n- **Author**: Melinda Ozel\n- **Published**: February 20, 2020\n- **Updated**: October 30, 2025\n</result>",

These phonemes are bilabial, meaning they are produced by bringing the upper and lower lips together. More information can be found on the webpage https://melindaozel.com/viseme-cheat-sheet."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the phonemes included in the m/b/p viseme group?",
        "answer": "The m/b/p viseme group includes the phonemes /m/, /b/, and /p/. /m/ is a nasal, voiced phoneme; /b/ is a plosive, voiced phoneme; and /p/ is a plosive, voiceless phoneme."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are the phonemes /m/, /b/, and /p/ produced?",
        "answer": "The phonemes /m/, /b/, and /p/ are produced by bringing the upper and lower lips together, known as bilabial phonemes. For /m/, /b/, and /p/, the lips need to close entirely or nearly entirely. Additionally, /b/ and /p/ require the lips to part after the initial lip closure to propel air for the plosive sound."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is understanding the m/b/p viseme group important?",
        "answer": "Understanding the m/b/p viseme group is crucial for applications such as speech recognition, lip reading, and facial animation because these phonemes are visually indistinct from one another due to the similar lip movements involved in their production."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find more information about the m/b/p viseme group?",
        "answer": "More information about the m/b/p viseme group can be found on the webpage https://melindaozel.com/viseme-cheat-sheet, which includes a detailed viseme cheat sheet, references, and links to related videos and guides."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who authored the webpage containing information about the m/b/p viseme group?",
        "answer": "The webpage containing information about the m/b/p viseme group was authored by Melinda Ozel. The page also provides citation information for academic use."
      },
      {
        "question": "When are the lips supposed to part during the production of /b/ and /p/ sounds?",
        "answer": "During the production of /b/ and /p/ sounds, the lips need to part after the initial lip closure to propel air for the plosive sound."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the significance of the m/b/p viseme group in speech recognition?",
        "answer": "The m/b/p viseme group is significant in speech recognition because the phonemes /m/, /b/, and /p/ are visually indistinct from one another, making it challenging to distinguish between them based on lip movements alone."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the production of /m/ differ from /b/ and /p/?",
        "answer": "/m/ is a nasal, voiced phoneme, whereas /b/ and /p/ are plosive phonemes. /b/ is voiced, and /p/ is voiceless. The production of /m/ involves bringing the lips together without the subsequent release required for /b/ and /p/."
      },
      {
        "question": "What type of phonemes are /m/, /b/, and /p/ classified as?",
        "answer": "/m/, /b/, and /p/ are classified as bilabial phonemes because they are produced by bringing the upper and lower lips together."

If your main goal is to capture data for a product aimed toward co-working, you’d likely want to prioritize prosocial, collaborative, and everyday expressions. \n2. **Design for logical flow.** Group similar expressions together, e.g. brow-based poses, eye-based poses, etc. Go from easy to difficult within that section. \n3. **Make sure your example imagery and descriptions match the target pose.** Too many times, prompts like “raise brows without widening eyes” are given, yet the actor in the shot is clearly widening their eyes. \n   - One more tip: Use accessible descriptors to increase the likelihood of your participant hitting the pose, e.g., saying “push up your bottom lip” for the action known as chin raiser.\n\n## Additional Information\n- The article is categorized under [facial expressions](https://melindaozel.com/category/facial-expressions/), [free content](https://melindaozel.com/category/free/), and [tech](https://melindaozel.com/category/tech/).\n- Related content links are provided at the end of the article, including \"Squishy Faces & Expressions\" and \"Facial Blanching and Blood Flow.\"\n- The webpage also includes a section about the author, Melinda Ozel, who is a facial motion expert specializing in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and facial anatomy.\n</result>",
