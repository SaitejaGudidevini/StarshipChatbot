    "browser_content": "## Detailed Information about 'Do I have to make a Fast Track payment'\n\n### 1. Explanation of 'Do I have to make a Fast Track payment' and its Purpose\n- **What is Fast Track?**: Fast Track is a payment option that allows eligible Hoosiers to expedite the start of their coverage in the HIP Plus program. It involves making a $10 payment while the application is being processed. This payment goes toward the first POWER account contribution.\n- **Purpose**: The purpose of Fast Track is to allow HIP Plus coverage to begin the first of the month in which the Fast Track payment is made, thus expediting the coverage start date.\n\n### 2. Relevant Links and Information\n- **Links Mentioned on the Page**:\n  - https://www.mhsindiana.com/members/hip.html - Main page for Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) information.\n  - https://www.mhsindiana.com/members/hip.html# - Internal links to various sections on the HIP page.\n- **Phone Numbers**:\n  - 1-877-GET-HIP-9 (1-877-438-4479) - For help with selecting a health plan.\n  - 1-877-647-4848 - For making a payment with My Health Pays Rewards.\n\n### 3. Instructions and Resources\n- **How to Make a Fast Track Payment**:\n  1. Online during application using a credit card.\n  2. After applying, through an invoice from the selected Managed Care Entity (MCE).\n- **Managed Care Entities (MCEs)**:\n  - Anthem\n  - Caresource\n  - MDwise\n  - MHS\n- **Implications of Not Making a Fast Track Payment**:\n  - Delay in the start of HIP Plus coverage. Coverage begins the first of the month after the payment is made.\n  - Default to HIP Basic if income is below the federal poverty level and no payment is made within 60 days. HIP Basic involves copayments and does not cover dental, vision, or chiropractic services.\n\n### 4. Key Features and Capabilities\n- **HIP Plus Benefits**:\n  - Includes dental, vision, and chiropractic services.\n  - No copayments except for non-emergency use of the emergency room.\n- **POWER Account Contribution**:\n  - Based on income.\n  - The $10 Fast Track payment is applied toward this contribution.\n\n### 5. Other Relevant Information\n- **Eligibility and Coverage**:\n  - HIP Plus coverage begins the first of the month in which the Fast Track payment is made.\n  - If not eligible for HIP, the Fast Track payment is refunded.\n- **Payment Consequences**:\n  - If the POWER account contribution is less than $10, the remaining amount covers future months.\n  - If it's more than $10, the balance is owed for the first month.\n\n### Conclusion\nMaking a Fast Track payment is not mandatory but expedites HIP Plus coverage. Individuals have 60 days from the initial Fast Track invoice to make a payment to start their HIP Plus coverage. Failure to make a payment within 60 days may result in being defaulted to HIP Basic if income is below the federal poverty level.\n\nAttachments:\n\nextracted_content_0.md:\n<url>\nhttps://www.mhsindiana.com/members/hip.html\n</url>\n<query>\nHIP Fast Track section details\n</query>\n<result>\n## HIP Fast Track Section Details\n\n### What is Fast Track?\nFast Track is a payment option that allows eligible Hoosiers to expedite the start of their coverage in the HIP Plus program. It allows making a $10 payment while the application is being processed. The $10 payment goes toward the first POWER account contribution.\n\n### Key Details:\n1. **Coverage Start Date**: If a Fast Track payment is made and the individual is eligible for HIP, HIP Plus coverage begins the first of the month in which the Fast Track payment was made.\n2. **Payment Method**: Fast Track payments can be made by credit card when applying online or after applying while the application is being processed.\n3. **Managed Care Entity (MCE)**: The payment is made to the selected MCE or health plan (Anthem, Caresource, MDwise, or MHS). The MCE cannot be changed after making the payment.\n4. **Consequence of Not Making a Fast Track Payment**: Without a Fast Track payment, there may be a delay in the start of coverage. For instance, applying on June 5 and making a $10 Fast Track payment in June can make HIP Plus coverage effective from June 1. If the payment is made in July, coverage starts July 1.\n5. **POWER Account Contribution**: The $10 Fast Track payment is applied toward the POWER account contribution, which is based on income. If the contribution is less than $10, the remaining amount covers future months.

    "browser_content": "## CHILDRENS EYE HEALTH SAFETY\n\n### Explanations\n\n1. **First Eye Exam**: Children should have their first eye exam at 6 months old to ensure normal development.\n2. **Annual Eye Exams**: Annual exams are crucial as children's vision can change over time. Common pediatric eye conditions can be prevented or detected early.\n3. **Vision Screening vs. Comprehensive Eye Exam**: School vision screenings are not a substitute for comprehensive eye exams. Children may pass screenings but still have underlying issues.\n4. **Components of a Comprehensive Eye Exam**: Tests may include eye tracking, focusing, eye-hand coordination, and eye teaming. Specific tests vary by age.\n5. **Post-Exam Activities**: Children can typically return to school or daycare after an exam unless the doctor advises otherwise.\n6. **Glasses for Children**: MHS members are entitled to one routine vision exam and new eyeglasses every year. Replacement glasses or frames are available as needed.\n\n### Key Features and Tips for Eye Safety\n\n1. **Protective Eyewear**: Ensure children wear appropriate protective eyewear during sports.\n2. **Toy Safety**: Avoid toys with darts, pellets, or flying pieces.\n3. **Household Safety**: Teach children to use pointed objects safely.\n4. **UV Protection**: Wear sunglasses outdoors to prevent UV damage.\n5. **Screen Time**: Take regular breaks from screens to prevent eyestrain.\n\n### Links\n\n1.
